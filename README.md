# pypackaging-native

pypackaging-native is a collection of content about key Python packaging topics
and issues for projects using native code - with a focus in particular
scientific, data science and ML/AI projects in the PyData ecosystem.

The purpose of the content in this repository and
[the website built from it](https://pypackaging-native.github.io)
is to explain what these key issues are, why they're
important, and (briefly) potential solution directions. This in order to get
others - in particular maintainers of Python packaging tools and others
heavily involved in Python packaging - on the same page when we are discussing
solutions. These topics are complex enough that in the past, discussions have
often gone around in circles because people weren't on the same page. Our hope
is that this content will serve to avoid that problem, so we can either make
headway with solving these problems _or_ decide that a problem is too complex
to solve or potential solutions are blocked by other use cases and needs.

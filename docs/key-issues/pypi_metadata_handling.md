# Metadata handling on PyPI

A very brief intro and some context.


## Current state

Inability to hotfix old releases (e.g. upper bound on setuptools for
numpy/pandas/scipy)

conda(-forge) does this with repodata patching


## Problems

What are the most important issues for end users, maintainers, packagers, etc.
as a result of this "key issue"?


## History

If there is relevant history (e.g., recent design changes, or potential
solutions people tried in the past), explain that here.


## Relevant resources

Links to key issues, forum discussions, PEPs, blog posts, etc.


## Potential solutions or mitigations

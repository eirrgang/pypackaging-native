# PyPI's author-led social model and its limitations

A very brief intro and some context.


## Current state

A thorough description of the current state of this "key issue".


## Problems

- One concrete problem is that it's difficult to do anything that requires
  coordination across projects. For example, rebuilding all projects for a new
  Python interpreter, toolchain change, or common library or protocol like
  Protobuf or DLPack (upgrading in sync after a possible breaking change is
  easier than staggered upgrades).


## History

If there is relevant history (e.g., recent design changes, or potential
solutions people tried in the past), explain that here.


## Relevant resources

Links to key issues, forum discussions, PEPs, blog posts, etc.


## Potential solutions or mitigations
